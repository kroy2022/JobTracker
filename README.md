# JobTracker Chrome Extension

## Overview

This chrome extension detects when you are on a job application and allows you to save the link, status, position, and date applied so you never lose track of where you have applied

Future editions: 
  - Fix logic for potential application
  - Enhance UI
  - Alert you if you've already applied for a job
